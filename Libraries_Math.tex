\chapter{Math Library}


Math is a library that comes standard with Python. Math allows for
more complex mathematical functions to be run, that aren't sorted
out by plain integer arithmetic.

Note the value $\mathit{e}\approx2.71828$


\section{math.sqrt(x)}

Obtains the square root of x.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import math 
>>> math.sqrt(9) 
3.0
\end{verbatim}



\section{math.log}

With only x, returns logarithm of x to base $\mathit{e}$.

With x and base, returns logarithm of x to the base specified.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import math 
>>> math.log(27) 
3.295836866004329 
>>> math.log(1000,10) 
2.9999999999999996
\end{verbatim}
