\paragraph{Random library (random)}

The random library is a library that comes default with Python that
allows for, as its title implies, random generation of numbers. In
reality, however, the numbers are pseudorandom (not truly random)
- but this is enough for most usage of random numbers.


\subparagraph{random.uniform(minimum,maximum)}

Generates a random float number between the set minimum and maximum
values, based on a uniform distribution

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import random 
>>> random.uniform(0,10) 
9.732061779717679
\end{lstlisting}



\subparagraph{random.randint(minimum,maximum)}

Generates a random integer number between the set minimum and maximum
values, based on a uniform distribution

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import random
>>> random.randint(0,10)
8
\end{lstlisting}
