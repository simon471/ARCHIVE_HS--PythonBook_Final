\chapter{Random}
\section{Intro}
Random is a library that you can used to generate random numbers in python.
\section{Creating random numbers}
You can use a code to generate random numbers.
\begin{verbatim}
import random    *You need to import random before you generate random numbers
random.uniform(minimum,maximum)
\end{verbatim}
while minimum and maximum number can be intergers(0) or floats(0.0)

\section{Usage of random number}
Simply here is a example of how to add random numbers to an array
\begin{verbatim}
import random
a=[]
for i in range(N):    *N is the the number of how many random numbers you want to add to the array
    a=a+[random.uniform(0,100)]   
         *0 is the minimum number and 100 is the maximum number, they are variable, you can change to 
          numbers you want.
    
\end{verbatim}
Here is a example of using random function to randomly fill a 2-D array with 0 and 1 by how many percentage you want it is filled.

\begin{verbatim}
import random
def fill(a,p):    *a is the name or you 2-D array    *p is the percentage you want, such as: 0.1, 0.25....
    for i in range(len(a)):    *len(a) is the length of you array
        for j in range(len(a)):
        	    if random.uniform(0,1)<p:
	        a[i][j]=1
	    else:
	        a[i][j]=0
\end{verbatim}
