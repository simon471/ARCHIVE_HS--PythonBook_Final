\begin{verbatim}
The string module contains a number of useful constants
and classes,
 as well as some deprecated legacy functions that are also
 available as methods on strings.
 In addition, Pythons built-in string classes support 
 the sequence type methods described in the Sequence Types 
  str,
 unicode, list, tuple, bytearray, buffer, xrange section,
 and also the string-specific methods described in the String
  Methods section.
 To output formatted strings use template strings or 
 the % operator described in the String Formatting Operations
  section.
 Also, see the re module for string functions based on regular
  expressions
