What the strings are:

In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented as an array of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. A string may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.

Python has a printf()-like facility to put together a string. The \% operator takes a printf-type format string on the left (\%d int, \%s string, \%f\%g floating point), and the matching values in a tuple on the right (a tuple is made of values separated by commas, typically grouped inside parenthesis)

In case of def, it is the string that the word right behind the def
len(a) is the length of (a)
range is the limitation of the array from something to something. If there is a number of range, it starts from 0 to a-1
If there is (a,b), it starts from a to b-1
print gives the answer of the code and literally gives the answer
return keep the answer for using again.
import is for bringing libraries
\# is a comment for code that makes codes not to work
